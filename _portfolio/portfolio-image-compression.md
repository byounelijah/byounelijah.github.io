title: "Image Compression Kmeans GMM"
excerpt: "A Python implementation of image compression algorithms using K-Means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with Expectation-Maximization. Implements both discrete clustering (K-Means with random and K-Means++ initialization) and probabilistic clustering (GMM with EM algorithm) to compress images by reducing color palettes while maintaining visual quality. Includes support for various image formats, reconstruction error metrics (MSE), and comparison visualization between algorithms.<br/>"
